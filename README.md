Food Wastage Reduction is a web-based platform designed to address the issue of food waste by collecting leftover food from donors such as hotels, restaurants, and marriage halls, and distributing it to those in need through NGOs. This system involves three types of users: Admin, Donor, and NGO.

## Features
**User Registration and Login:** Donors and NGOs can register and create an account on the website. They will be required to provide necessary information and credentials for verification.

**Verification Process:** The admin will verify the registrations of donors and NGOs to prevent fraudulent requests or fake supplies.

**Donation and Need Requests:** Once verified, donors and NGOs can raise requests for donation and assistance respectively. Donors can provide details about the food quality, cooking time, meal types (dinner or lunch), and the number of packages available. NGOs can view the history of restaurants, including food quality and the number of packages, and send requests to the restaurants if they need to manage their excess or leftover food.

**Address Management:** NGOs can access the address information of restaurants to arrange for the collection of food donations.

**Promoting Food Distribution:** The platform facilitates the efficient redistribution of excess food from donors to those in need, reducing food wastage and ensuring that valuable resources are utilized effectively.
